# Next.js + Jest + Testing Library + cypress

This example shows how to configure Jest to work with Next.js.

This includes Next.js' built-in support for Global CSS, CSS Modules and TypeScript. This example also shows how to use Jest with the App Router and React Server Components.

> **Note:** Since tests can be co-located alongside other files inside the App Router, we have placed those tests in `app/` to demonstrate this behavior (which is different than `pages/`). You can still place all tests in `__tests__` if you prefer.

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```
